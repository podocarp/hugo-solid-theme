# Greetings.

Hi there and welcome to my website. For now this site is separated into two distinct parts, the blog and the photo gallery. Here give an overview about them:

# Blog

## Sections and Categories

I will post lots of stuff about vastly differing subjects.
For your convenience all these are tagged and categorized accordingly.
At the top of most sections you will see some recommended sections.

```text
... Check out these sections: history/greek
```

So if you don't want to get blasted with all sorts of posts of different subjects, click on those links to get to a page populated with specific types of posts only.

Most posts will have a small "categories" line below their summary and in their pages, like 

```text
Categories: greek book history
```

The function is the same, yet is a little different. These apply site wide, so all posts of whatever you click will appear. `Greek` can refer to the language or history. Sometimes you may be looking for this, most of the time I recommend you use the links at the top of the page instead for more a more specific lookup.

## Images

Most images can popup into a larger on if you click them. Also I may forget to cite where I got them sometimes, please contact me if so.

# Photography

I don't want to share this with my blog. They have different needs; the blog tries to compact the text so that it is easier to read. On mobiles the text covers the whole screen because the screen is small, but on desktops it only takes a small part so that your eyes don't have to race around. However, for a photo gallery we really want to take up as much space as possible and who cares about reading text?

The color has also been picked to be nicer to look at.
We use white for text because more light causes the pupils to constrict which then results in a larger depth of field, resulting in clearer reading.
However for images a dark background results in less strain and more comfortable viewing.

# About

This is starting to become a readme; where's the actual about page?
Here it is: judge the site based on the content and come to the conclusion by yourself, not by what I tell you to believe.
